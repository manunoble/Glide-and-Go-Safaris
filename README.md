# Glide-and-Go-Safaris

The website is about a rectreational compny, GLIDE AND GO SAFARIS, which involve creating trips and camps for clients, whether a group of friends, colleagues, family e.t.c, to enjoy their prefered destinations. They make it easier for clients to access the destinations, get fair prices since they offer cuts in transport, accomodation and a few activities.

It is just a one page website for advertizing the company and showing the seriousness and legitness of the company. It also shows ways to contact them through any platforms and even phone numbers.

Had a chance to code my first website using react.js. Has been a challenge truly, from errors to export issues to now being able to write this. It is still young and not as complex but growing is all about appreciating the steps while setting more challenging goals to reach the ambition of being a full developer of Website development.

Feel free to challenge this code, assist where it looks bizzare and what a start of this challengeuous journey.
